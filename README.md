Design a POJO class. Next, create a Java config class with @configuration and @bean annotations 
to configure POJO instance values or set up Java components with @component, @repository, @service, or @controller annotations
to later create POJO instance values. Next, instantiate the Spring IoC container to scan for Java classes with annotations. 
The POJO instances or bean instances then become accessible to put together as part of an application.
